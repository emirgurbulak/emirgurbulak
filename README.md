# Hi there, I'm Mehmet Emir! 👋

### 👨‍💻 Computer Engineering Student & Full-Stack Developer
I am a Computer Engineering student at **Istanbul Aydin University** and an incoming Erasmus+ scholar at **Politechnika Krakowska (Poland)** for the Spring 2026 semester.

I bridge the gap between **academic engineering principles** (C++, OOP, Data Structures) and **modern web development** (TypeScript, React ecosystem). My focus is on building scalable, type-safe applications for FinTech and Operation Management.
